# Solutions to the Rosalind Challenges

These are my successful attempts to the [Rosalind Challenges](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/). These are currently all in python.

I am writing all of my solutions in defined reusable functions, which means that I will be able to call the functions from earlier problems to speed up solving more difficult problems. Each file is named according to the corresponding ID.
